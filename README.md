### Project Overview

This project explores the Spotify music dataset using MySQL to uncover insights about songs, artists, albums, and user listening patterns.
The goal is to practice SQL queries for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analysis while answering real-world business questions.

## Tasks
1. Retrieve all the names  of all the tracks that have more than one billion streams
2. List the albums along with their respective artists
3. Get the total number of comments for the tracks where licensed = True
4. Count the total number of tracks by each artist
5. Count the average Danceability of the tracks in each album
6. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values
7. List all the tracks along with the total views and total likes of all the associated tracks
8. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks
9. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than on YouTube
10. Find the top 3 most viewed tracks for each artist using the window function
11. Write a query to find tracks where the Liveness is greater than the average
12. Using with clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album

### Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
Artist : The performer of the track.
Track : The name of the song.
Album : The album to which the track belongs.
Album_type : The type of album (e.g., single or album).
Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

### Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

### Easy Queries
Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.

### Medium Queries
More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.

### Advanced Queries
Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.
